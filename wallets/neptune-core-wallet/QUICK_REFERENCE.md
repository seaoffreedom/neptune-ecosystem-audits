**Privacy Score:** ★★★★★ (10/10)

## 🔐 What Law Enforcement Can Do

### To Surveil You, They Must:

1. ✅ Obtain search warrant (Fourth Amendment protection)
2. ✅ Physically seize your computer
3. ✅ Extract wallet file (requires device access)
4. ✅ Analyze blockchain (public but pseudonymous)

### What They CANNOT Do:

- ❌ Simple subpoena to get data (no central server exists)
- ❌ Remote monitoring (fully decentralized)
- ❌ Bulk data collection (no database to query)
- ❌ Silent surveillance without physical access
- ❌ IP correlation via single server (P2P = many nodes)

**Legal Threshold:** Search warrant + device seizure (HIGH bar)

## 🆚 Quick Comparison to VxBlocks Wallet

| Aspect             | Neptune Core Wallet          | VxBlocks Wallet       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Privacy**        | 🟢 Complete                  | 🔴 None               |
| **Surveillance**   | 🟢 Impossible without device | 🔴 Easy via subpoena  |
| **Trust Required** | 🟢 None                      | 🔴 VxBlocks           |
| **Architecture**   | 🟢 Local full node           | 🔴 Centralized server |
| **Setup Time**     | 🟡 Slow (sync required)      | 🟢 Fast               |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seaoffreedom/neptune-core-wallet.git
cd neptune-core-wallet
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

### First Run

1. **Initial Sync:** Be patient - blockchain download takes time
2. **Data Location:** `~/.local/share/neptune/`
3. **Disk Space:** Ensure 20+ GB available
4. **Backup:** Save your seed phrase immediately

### Configuration

- **Network:** Main, Testnet, or Regtest
- **Peers:** Connects automatically to P2P network
- **RPC:** localhost:9799 (neptune-core) and localhost:9801 (neptune-cli)
- **Authentication:** Cookie-based (random per session)

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Essential

- ✅ Backup seed phrase (write it down, store securely)
- ✅ Use full disk encryption
- ✅ Keep system updated
- ✅ Firewall configured properly

### Enhanced Privacy

- ✅ Use Tor for P2P connections (hide IP from network)
- ✅ Dedicated machine for crypto operations
- ✅ No other applications running
- ✅ Offline signing for maximum security

### Recovery

- Your seed phrase is EVERYTHING
- Store multiple copies in secure locations
- Never share with anyone
- Never store digitally (write on paper)

---

## ⚠️ Minor Considerations

### Block Explorer Links

**Issue:** Some UI components link to `neptune.vxb.ai` for block viewing

**Risk Level:** 🟡 LOW

**Why:**

- These are optional, user-initiated actions
- Just opens block explorer in browser (read-only)
- Does NOT send transaction data automatically
- User chooses whether to click

**Mitigation:** Simply don't click the links if concerned

### Price Display

**Issue:** Uses CoinGecko API for Neptune price in USD

**Risk Level:** 🟡 LOW

**Why:**

- Only for displaying price
- No wallet data sent
- Public API query
- Optional feature

**Mitigation:** Ignore price display if concerned
